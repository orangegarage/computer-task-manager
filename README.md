# computer-task-manager
This is just a reformatting of the original 'computer process audit' that I did because the original code was so long and extensive to break down.
I have separated html(hta), css, and script(vbs in this case)
Note that script is still long bc i haven't separated those into separate ones based on function.

Additional changes-

TO HTA INTERFACE
1. added an icon so its cuter (corporate logos can be cute too righhhht)
2. Enabled scrollbar (HTA:application)
3. Currently, the windows size adjusts to a static size, will change to a more dynamic window for 4k support - may need to take home to test on my monitor


TO CHANGE
1. Script legibility (split into multiple functions)
2. html legibility (follow better practice in css customization)
3. Script speed (each refresh takes too long. Understand that script may be faulty and look into a better algorithm
