Version 2.01 last edit 06/20/19 by jinyong.jeong@mckenneys.com

This is just a reformatting of the original 'computer process audit' that I did because the original code was so long and extensive to break down.
I have used a standard web application structure and separated html(hta), css, and script(vbs in this case)
Note that script is still long bc i haven't separated those into separate ones based on function.

Additional changes-

TO HTA INTERFACE
1. added an icon so its cuter
2. Enabled scrollbar (HTA:application)
3. Currently, the windows size adjusts to a static size, will change to a more dynamic window
